As of my last update in September 2021, Docker for Windows requires specific hardware features to be enabled in the BIOS for it to function properly. These features are hardware-assisted virtualization and Data Execution Prevention (DEP).

Hardware-assisted virtualization: This feature is usually referred to as Intel VT-x (for Intel processors) or AMD-V (for AMD processors). It allows the system to run virtual machines with better performance by offloading some virtualization tasks to the processor itself. Most modern processors have this feature, but it may be disabled in the BIOS by default.

Data Execution Prevention (DEP): DEP is a security feature that helps prevent malicious code from being executed in certain memory regions. It is often referred to as "NX" (No-eXecute) on Intel systems or "XD" (eXecute Disable) on AMD systems. DEP should be enabled in the BIOS to ensure a more secure computing environment.

To use Docker for Windows successfully, you'll need to check if these features are enabled in your computer's BIOS settings:

Reboot your computer and during the boot process, look for a prompt to enter the BIOS settings. The key to access BIOS varies depending on the manufacturer, but commonly it's one of the following keys: Del, F2, F10, or Esc. Refer to your computer's manual or manufacturer's website for specific instructions.

Once in the BIOS settings, look for options related to virtualization or hardware-assisted virtualization. It might be under "Advanced," "CPU Configuration," "Security," or a similar section, depending on your motherboard manufacturer.

Enable the virtualization feature (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) if it's disabled. Save the changes and exit the BIOS settings.

Additionally, ensure that Data Execution Prevention (DEP) is also enabled. This setting is usually found in the same or a nearby BIOS section related to processor and security options.

Save the BIOS settings and restart your computer.

After enabling these features, you should be able to run Docker for Windows without any issues related to hardware virtualization. Remember that the steps to access and configure BIOS settings can vary depending on the computer's make and model, so refer to your specific system's documentation for detailed instructions.

To access the BIOS settings on an HP computer, you can follow these general steps:

Shut down your HP computer: Make sure to save any open files and close all running applications before proceeding.

Turn on the computer: Press the power button to turn on the HP computer.

Start tapping the BIOS access key: Immediately and repeatedly press the specific key that allows you to access the BIOS during the boot process. The key to access BIOS on HP computers is usually one of the following: Esc, F1, F2, F10, F12, or Delete. Different HP models might use different keys, so try each of these keys one by one until you see the BIOS setup screen.

Use the BIOS menu: Once you successfully enter the BIOS, you'll navigate through the settings using the keyboard. The BIOS interface may vary depending on the model and manufacturer, but it is typically text-based with options listed on the screen. Use the arrow keys to move between options, and refer to the instructions on the screen to make changes.

Enable hardware-assisted virtualization and DEP: Look for settings related to virtualization or hardware features in the BIOS. Enable the hardware-assisted virtualization feature (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) and also make sure that Data Execution Prevention (DEP) is enabled.

Save changes and exit: After making the necessary changes, save the settings and exit the BIOS. Usually, you can do this by pressing the F10 key to save and exit. Confirm any prompts to save changes if asked.

Computer restarts: Your HP computer will now restart with the updated BIOS settings.

Remember that accessing the BIOS on HP computers may vary depending on the model and BIOS version. If the keys mentioned above don't work, consult your computer's manual or visit HP's support website for specific instructions related to your model.
