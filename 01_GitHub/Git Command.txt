git init
<It is used to initialize the empty git repo in the file system.

git status
<This is used to keep track of the files that have been created and not added it will tell us names of untracked files in the directory>

git add . 
git add -A
<We can add all the files for the staging area i.e their progress will be stored in the local file in the machine>

git add filename
<Individual file can be added for progress detection>

git restore --staged fileName
<Suppose we want to take back file added to the staging area back then at that point we will be taking it back using above command>

git commit -m"message here"
<All the changed made will be visible to world and hence they can be seen by world>

git log
<This will give us all the history of commit that we have made previously>

if we want project at any given stage then
copy hashcode of that commit

git reset <hashcode>

it will be restored and hence other will be in the unstaged area

git stash
<Project files will be in the backstage and everything will be reverted>

git pop
<All the files in the backstage will be again take forward>

git stash clear
<All the files in the background will be deleted>

branch 
<Default name of the branch is main>
if we want to add new features then we should create separate branch
we should never commit on the main branch
hence we should change the branch and modify

git branch nameOfBranch
<create the new branch with nameOfBranch>

git checkout nameOfBranch
<Go to the branch of the name>

to merge the code in the main branch

git checkout main
git merge nameOfBranch
<Here we will have nameOfBranch merged into the main branch>


wokring with existing project

We have to send pull request to the existing code

first fork the project into our profile
we can do anything with it


git clone url
it will download all the project in the local system from our own system

we can add upstream url
git add upstream <link>
link of projects will be added in the file
