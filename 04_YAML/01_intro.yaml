# first it used to be called as 'Yet another markup language'

# but now it is called as YAML ain't markup language
# as it is just a data format which is used to exchange data
# simillar to xml and json
# in yaml only data can be stored and command cannot be stored in yaml

# data serialization: 
  # it is a process where object are converted into byte stream
  # this is done so that this byte stream can be shared with many applications like android,  web and many more.
  # serialization is only used for transportation of data and not to use in the applications
  # after serialization it can be stored in memory, database or in yaml file
  # hence serialization is converting objects into stram of bytes and can be transported into many files
  # yam;, json and xml are called as serialization language
  # to use that data again in the application data is again de-serialized

  # object -> stream serialization
  # stream -> objects de-serialization

# uses of yaml
  # configuration file of Docker and kubernates
  # logs and cache

# benefits of yaml
  # easy to read
  # simple
  # strict syntax
  # indentation is imp
  # easily convertable
  # most language uses yaml
  # more powerful when representing complex data
  # various tools like parser can be used
